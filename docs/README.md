### Contributing

We accept pull requests!
PRs not ready to be merged yet should include `[WIP]` at the beginning of their title.

Please avoid doing `merge` commits.

When `pull`ing, always do `git pull --rebase -i`.
If any conflicts arise, either solve them and `git rebase --continue` or ask for help :)

Use 4 tabs for indentation and make sure you run your code through a utility such as [autopep8][] in order to ensure PEP8 compliance.
For docstring documentation, usage of a utility is also encouraged. See [pyment][] for an example.
Finally, a linter like [pylint][]
